# Projects
Here lies all my projects so far!
The Piscine folder, is where all the projects I did in the course of 42 Lisboa during the piscine time. This was a 4 really intense weeks that I learned mostly C and Shell.

The C# Project is the folder that has the project I did in C# for the course of Code Developer I did. The final project consisted in a Recepies website, so I did a windows forms back end program to manage the website, a SQL data base and a website. Unfortunatly the project is not finished but I got a 14 grade from 20. 

The Revestir folder has a project that I did for my wife and her second hand shop. It consist basically on a simple Back-End Windows Forms Project to help organize in her job. It still needs some ajustments.

C# Projects is a folder that contains all my recent C# projects.

The last folder is 42 Projects, is where all the project I did and currently doing for the main course in 42 Lisboa.
